### Class Participation (10%)

We will have an "in class" questionnaire handed out in each
lecture and which is to be turned in at the end of the lecture.
Respond to 75% of the questionnaires to get full credit.
Responses will not be graded on correctness but only on completion.

### Homework Assignments (30%)

There will be _six_ [programming assignments](assignments.html),
assigned every one or two weeks.

### Midterms (30%)

There will be **two** closed-book, pencil-and-paper midterm exams,
each worth 15% of the grade (each) -- to be held during lecture on
on **Tu 1/28** and **Th 2/20**.

**Cheat Sheet** You may bring a "cheat sheet" comprising a single
letter-sized sheet of paper (you can use both sides if you wish.)

### Final (30%)

The closed-book, pencil-and-paper final exam will be held on
**Tu 3/18** from 8:00--11:00am.
