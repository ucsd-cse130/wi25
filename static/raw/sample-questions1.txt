Problem 1:
---------

For each ML function given below, if the function is well typed, then
write down its type, otherwise explain in less than two lines why Ocaml 
rejects the function.

(a)
let rec rev l = 
  match l with 
    [] -> []
  | (h::t) -> (rev t)::h

(b)
let rec f l = 
  match l with
    [] -> []
  | (h::t) -> (List.hd h)::t


(c)
let rec f (tup,l) = 
  match l with 
    [] -> 0
  | (h::t) -> tup.h + f (tup,t)

(d)
let rec f (x,y) =
  if x then (List.hd y) + 20
  else if not x then 0 else y

(e)
let rec f l = 
  match l with
    [] -> []
  | f (h::t) -> h @ (flatten t)  

_________________________________________________________________________

Problem 2:
---------

Which of the functions below are tail recursive ? 
Also, for each function, write down its type.
For the ones that are not, write down tail 
recursive versions that achieve the same task.

(a)
let rec map f l = 
  match l with 
    [] -> []
  | (h::t) -> (f h) :: (map f t)  

(b)
let rec fold f b l = 
  match l with 
    [] -> b
  | (h::t) -> fold f (f (h,b)) t  

(c)
let rec len l = 
  match l with
    [] -> 0
  | (h::t) -> 1 + len t

(d)
let rec f (n,l) = 
  match l with 
    [] -> n
  | (n,h::t) = if (h>n) then f (h,t) else f(n,t)



Solution: run Ocaml to get types.
--------

(a) Not tail recursive.
    let map f l = 
        let rec helper (acc,l') =
	  match l' with 
	    [] -> acc 
	  | (acc,h::t) = helper((f h)::acc,t)
	in
	  List.rev(helper([],l))

(b) Tail recursive.

(c) Not tail recursive.
    let len l = 
        let rec helper (n,l') =
	  match l' with 
	    [] -> n
	  | helper (n,_::t) = helper(s+1,t)
	in
	  helper(0,t)
	

(d) Tail recursive.

Problem 3:
---------

The following datatype can be used to represent arbitrarily nested
lists. 

type 'a nlist = Nil | Cons of 'a elt * 'a nlist
and 'a elt = E of 'a | NL of 'a nlist

The list [1,2] could be represented as Cons(E 1,Cons(E 2,Nil)),
the list [[1],2] as Cons(NL(Cons((E 1),Nil)),Cons(E 2,Nil))
and the list [[[],[1]],2] as Cons(NL(Cons(NL Nil,Cons (E 1,Nil))), Cons(E 2,Nil)).

Using only pattern-matching (i.e. no if-then-else expressions):

(a) Write a function: nlist_toString: ('a -> string) -> 'a nlist -> string
    such that if nl is bound to Cons(NL(Cons(NL Nil,Cons (E 1,Nil))), Cons(E 2,Nil)), 
    then (nlist_toString Int.toString nl) evaluates to: "[[[],[1]],2]".

(b) Write a function flatten: 'a nlist -> 'a list that returns 
    the list of elements appearing in the nested list in order. 
    Thus when applied to any of the lists shown above, flatten 
    returns the list [1,2].

Problem 4:
---------

We say that two expressions e1 and e2 are semantically equivalent 
if in every environment E, evaluating e1 and evaluating e2 produces 
the same result. For each  of the  following pairs of  expressions, 
explain why they are semantically equivalent, or if not, then give 
an environment that distinguishes the two, i.e. in which evaluating 
the two expressions gives different results.

(a)
  (* e1 *) let x = 0 in x 
  
  (* e2 *) let x = (f 1) * 0 in x
  
(b)
  (* e1 *) (fun a -> fun b -> a + b) p q 
  
  (* e2 *) (fun b -> fun a -> b + a) p q
    
(c)  
  (* e1 *)
   let x = a + 1 in 
   let y = b + 2 in 
     2*x + 3*y
   
 
  (* e2 *)
   let y = b + 2 in
   let x = a + 1 in 
     2*x + 3*y
   

(d)
  (* e1 *)
   let x = a + 1 in
   let y = x + 2 in 
     2*x + 3*y
   
 
  (* e2 *)
   let y = x + 2 in
   let x = a + 1 in 
     2*x + 3*y

Solution:
--------

(a) Not equivalent: as f may not terminate or throw an exception! 
    Distinguishing environment: where f is: fun f x = f x

(b) Equivalent -- as the arguments or "formals" for the two functions 
    have just been renamed.

(c) Equivalent -- as only difference is order but the same expressions 
    are evaluated in both cases giving same values.
    
(d) Not Equivalent -- a distinguishing environment is where 
    x is bound to 0 and a is bound to 0,a are bound to 0,0. The "free" 
    occurrence of x gets its value 0 from the environment, and thus y 
    gets bound differently leading to different evaluations.

Problem 5: 
---------

Does the following code work correctly ? If not, find and fix the bug.

(a) For PA #2, Problem #1 (c):

    let rec ffor (i,j,f) = if i=j then () else ((f i); ffor (i+1,j,f))

(b) For PA #2, Problem #1 (b): Recall that isMember (x,l) returns true if the value x 
    appears in the list l, and listReverse l returns a list with the the
    elements of l in reversed order.
    
    let cleanList l = 
      let rec helper (seen,rest) = 
        match rest with 
          [] -> seen
        | h::t -> 
          let seen' = if isMember (h,t) then seen else (h::seen) in
          let rest' = t in 
	    helper (seen',rest')
      in
        listReverse (helper ([],l))

(c) Implementation of a function pow : 'a list -> 'a list list which takes a
    list [x1,...,xn] and returns the list of all subsets of {x1,...,xn}. That
    is: pow [1,2,3] should return [[],[1],[2],[3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]],
    though the actual "order" of the subsets doesnt matter (i.e. its ok to
    also return [[1,2,3],[1,2],[1],[2,3],[2],[1,3],[3],[]] (or any other
    permutation).

    let pow l = 
      match l with 
        [] -> []
      | (h::t) ->
          let val sub = pow t in
	  (map (fun l -> h::l) sub)
	  

_________________________________________________________________________


Problem 6:
---------

Consider the following structure:

module L : LSIG =
  struct
    type my int list = Empty | Cons of int * my int list
    exception BadList
    let makeOne i = Cons(i,Empty)
    let makeCons (i,l) = Cons(i,l)
    let my hd lst = ________________________
    let my tl lst = ________________________
  end

(a) Write bodies for my_hd and my_tl such that each takes a value of type 
    my_int_list, raises BadList if the value is Empty, and evaluates to the 
    first (for my_hd) or second (for my_tl) element of the pair that Cons carries.
     
(b) For each of the following LSIG definitions, determine if a client of 
    L can make BadList get raised. If so, give an example client for which 
    BadList is raised. If not, briefly explain why not.

   (i) 
    module type LSIG =
       sig
         datatype my_int_list = Empty | Cons of int * my_int_list
	 val my_hd : my_int_list -> int
	 val makeOne : int -> my_int_list
       end

   (ii) 
     module type LSIG =
       sig
	 type my_int_list
	 val makeCons : int * my_int_list -> my_int_list
         val my_hd : my_int_list -> int
         val makeOne : int -> my_int_list
       end

   (iii) 
     module type LSIG =
       sig
	 type my_int_list;
	 val makeCons : int * my_int_list -> my_int_list
	 val my_tl : my_int_list -> my_int_list
         val makeOne : int -> my_int_list
       end
