## Writing Applications

In most language related classes, we _start_ with a "Hello world!" program.

With 130, we will _end_ with it.

<!-- 
For example, in Python you may write:

```python
def main():
    print "hello, world!"

main()
```

and then you can run it:

```sh
$ python hello.py
hello world!
```

## Purity and the Immutability Principle

Haskell is a **pure** language. Not a _value_ judgment, but a precise _technical_ statement:

**The "Immutability Principle":**

- A function must _always_ return the same output for a given input

- A function's behavior should _never change_

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## No Side Effects

![](/static/img/trinity.png){#fig:types .align-center width=60%}

Haskell's most radical idea: `expression ==> value`

- When you evaluate an expression you get a value and **nothing else happens**

Specifically, evaluation must not have an **side effects**

- _change_ a global variable or

- _print_ to screen or

- _read_ a file or

- _send_ an email or

- _launch_ a missile.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Purity

Means _functions may depend only on their inputs_

- i.e. **functions should give the same output for the same input every time.**

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## But... how to write "Hello, world!"

But, we _want_ to ...

- print to screen
- read a file
- send an email

A language that only lets you write `factorial` and `fibonacci` is ... _not very useful_!

Thankfully, you _can_ do all the above via a very clever idea: `Recipe`

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Recipes

[This analogy is due to Joachim Brietner][brietner]

Haskell has a special type called `IO` -- which you can think of as `Recipe` 

```haskell
type Recipe a = IO a
```

A _value_ of type `Recipe a` is

- a **description** of an effectful computations

- when **when executed** (possibly) perform some effectful I/O operations to

- **produce** a value of type `a`.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>




## Recipes have No Effects

A value of type `Recipe a` is

- Just a **description** of an effectful computation

- An inert, perfectly safe thing with **no effects**.

![Cake vs. Recipe](/static/img/cake.png){#fig:types .align-center width=80%}

**(L)** chocolate _cake_, **(R)** a _sequence of instructions_ on how to make a cake.

They are different (_hint_: only one of them is delicious.)

Merely having a `Recipe Cake` has no effects: holding the recipe

- Does not make your oven _hot_

- Does not make your your floor _dirty_

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



## Executing Recipes

There is **only one way** to execute a `Recipe a`

Haskell looks for a special value

```haskell
main :: Recipe ()
```

The value associated with `main` is handed to the **runtime system and executed**

![Baker Aker](/static/img/baker-aker.jpg){#fig:types .align-center width=70%}

The Haskell runtime is a _master chef_ who is the only one allowed to cook!

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>




## How to write an App in Haskell

Make a `Recipe ()` that is handed off to the master chef `main`.

- `main` can be arbitrarily complicated

- will be composed of _many smaller_ recipes

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Hello World


```haskell
putStrLn :: String -> Recipe ()
```

The function `putStrLn`

- takes as input a `String`
- returns as output a `Recipe ()`

`putStrLn msg` is a `Recipe ()` _when executed_ prints out `msg` on the screen.

```haskell
main :: Recipe ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, world!"
```

... and we can compile and run it

```sh
$ ghc --make hello.hs
$ ./hello
Hello, world!
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## QUIZ: Combining Recipes

Next, lets write a program that prints multiple things:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = combine (putStrLn "Hello,") (putStrLn "World!")

-- putStrLn :: String -> Recipe ()
-- combine  :: ???
```

What must the _type_ of `combine` be?

```haskell
{- A -} combine :: () -> () -> ()
{- B -} combine :: Recipe () -> Recipe () -> Recipe ()
{- C -} combine :: Recipe a  -> Recipe a  -> Recipe a
{- D -} combine :: Recipe a  -> Recipe b  -> Recipe b
{- E -} combine :: Recipe a  -> Recipe b  -> Recipe a
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>




## Using Intermediate Results

Next, lets write a program that

1. **Asks** for the user's `name` using

```haskell
    getLine :: Recipe String
```

2. **Prints** out a greeting with that `name` using

```haskell
    putStrLn :: String -> Recipe ()
```

**Problem:** How to pass the **output** of _first_ recipe into the _second_ recipe?

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## QUIZ: Using Yolks to Make Batter

Suppose you have two recipes

```haskell
crack     :: Recipe Yolk
eggBatter :: Yolk -> Recipe Batter
```

and we want to get 

```haskell
mkBatter :: Recipe Batter
mkBatter = crack `combineWithResult` eggBatter
```

What must the type of `combineWithResult` be?

```haskell
{- A -} Yolk -> Batter -> Batter
{- B -} Recipe Yolk -> (Yolk  -> Recipe Batter) -> Recipe Batter
{- C -} Recipe a    -> (a     -> Recipe a     ) -> Recipe a
{- D -} Recipe a    -> (a     -> Recipe b     ) -> Recipe b
{- E -} Recipe Yolk -> (Yolk  -> Recipe Batter) -> Recipe ()
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Looks Familiar

Wait a bit, the signature looks familiar!

```haskell
combineWithResult :: Recipe a -> (a -> Recipe b) -> Recipe b
```

Remember this

```haskell
(>>=)             :: Result a -> (a -> Result b) -> Result b
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## `Recipe` is an instance of `Monad`

In fact, in the standard library

```haskell
instance Monad Recipe where
  (>>=) = {-... combineWithResult... -}
```

So we can put this together with `putStrLn` to get:

```haskell
main :: Recipe ()
main = getLine >>= \name -> putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")
```

or, using `do` notation the above becomes

```haskell
main :: Recipe ()
main = do name <- getLine
          putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## EXERCISE

1. _Compile_ and run to make sure its ok!

2. _Modify_ the above to repeatedly ask for names.

3. _Extend_ the above to print a "prompt" that tells you how many iterations have occurred.

## Monads are Amazing

Monads have had a _revolutionary_ influence in PL, well beyond Haskell, some recent examples

- **Error handling** in `go` e.g. [1](https://speakerdeck.com/rebeccaskinner/monadic-error-handling-in-go)  and [2](https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/golang-errors-monads/)

- **Asynchrony** in JavaScript e.g. [1](https://gist.github.com/MaiaVictor/bc0c02b6d1fbc7e3dbae838fb1376c80) and [2](https://medium.com/@dtipson/building-a-better-promise-3dd366f80c16)

- **Big data** pipelines e.g. [LinQ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dryadlinq/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

## A Silly App to End CSE 130

Lets write an app called [moo](/static/raw/moo.hs) inspired by [cowsay](https://medium.com/@jasonrigden/cowsay-is-the-most-important-unix-like-command-ever-35abdbc22b7f)

**A Command Line App**

![`moo`](/static/img/moo1.png){#fig:types .align-center width=70%}

**`moo` works with pipes**
