## A Programming Language

### Two Variables

- `x`, `y`

### Three Operations

- `x++`
- `x--`
- `x = 0 ? L1 : L2`

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Example Program

(What _does_ it do?)

```
L1: x++
    y--
    y = 0 ? L2 : L1
L2: ...
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## The above language is "equivalent to" every PL!

But good luck writing

- ... QuickSort

- ... Fortnite

- ... Spotify!

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## So Why Study Programming Languages?

## So Why Study Programming Languages?

> The principle of **linguistic relativity**
> holds that the structure of a language
> affects its speakers world view or cognition.

Or more simply:

> Programming Language
> shapes
> Programming Thought.

Language affects how ideas and computation are expressed

### New languages come (and go ...)

There was no

- Java 30 years ago
- C# 25 years ago
- Rust 15 years ago
- WebAssembly 5 years ago

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## What is CSE 130 about?

- Concepts in programming languages
- Programming paradigms
- Language design and implementation

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Goal: Learn the Anatomy of PL

![Anatomy](/static/img/anatomy.png){#fig:anatomy .align-center width=20%}

- What makes a programming language?
- Which features are **fundamental** and which are **syntactic sugar**?

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Goal: Learn New Languages / Constructs

![Musical Score](/static/img/music-score.png){#fig:music .align-center width=30%}

New ways to **describe** and **organize** computation,
to create programs that are:

- **Correct**
- **Readable**
- **Extendable**
- **Reusable**

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Goal: How to Design new Languages

New languages being designed in industry as we speak:

- Flow, React @ Facebook
- Rust @ Mozilla
- TypeScript @ Microsoft
- Swift @ Apple
- WebAssembly @ Google + Mozilla + Microsoft

Buried in every large system is a (domain-specific) language

- DB: SQL
- Word, Excel: Formulas, Macros, VBScript
- Emacs: LISP
- Latex, shell scripts, makefiles, ...

If you work on a large system, you **will** design a new PL!

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Goal: Enable You To Choose Right PL

But isn't that decided by

- Libraries
- Standards
- Hiring
- Your Boss?!

Yes.

**My goal:** Educate tomorrow's leaders so you'll make **informed** choices.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## What is CSE 130 **not** about?

Learning...

- JavaScript in January
- Haskell in February
- C++ in March

etc.

## Course Syllabus

**Functional Programming**

- Lambda calculus (2 weeks)
- Functional Programming (4 weeks)
- Building an Interpreter (3 weeks)

**Logic Programming**

- Prolog (~1 weekx, maybe, but doubtful!)

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **QuickSort** in C

```c
void sort(int arr[], int beg, int end){
  if (end > beg + 1){
    int piv = arr[beg];
    int l = beg + 1;
    int r = end;
    while (l != r-1)
       if(arr[l] <= piv) l++;
       else swap(&arr[l], &arr[r--]);
    if(arr[l]<=piv && arr[r]<=piv)
       l=r+1;
    else if(arr[l]<=piv && arr[r]>piv)
       {l++; r--;}
    else if (arr[l]>piv && arr[r]<=piv)
       swap(&arr[l++], &arr[r--]);
    else r=l-1;
    swap(&arr[r--], &arr[beg]);
    sort(arr, beg, r);
    sort(arr, l, end);
  }
}
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **QuickSort** in Haskell

```Haskell
sort []     = []
sort (x:xs) = sort ls ++ [x] ++ sort rs
  where
    ls      = [ l | l <- xs, l <= x ]
    rs      = [ r | r <- xs, x <  r ]
```

(**Note:** not a wholly [fair comparison...](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7717691/why-is-the-minimalist-example-haskell-quicksort-not-a-true-quicksort))

## Clicker Protocol

1. **Solo Vote**

   - Think for yourself, select answer

2. **Discuss**

   - Analyze problem in groups
   - Reach consensus
   - Have questions, raise your hand!
