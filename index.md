## Overview

Programming Languages are the duct tape, bricks, mortar
and steel of the information age. Over the last thirty
years, a variety of languages with diverse features have
been developed, expressing radically different perspectives
of the idea of computation. CSE 130 is an introduction to
some of these perspectives, as well as the fundamental
concepts of languages.

We shall focus on two different paradigms -- functional
and logic programming as embodied in Haskell and Prolog.
Many students will be encountering these
paradigms, languages and idioms for the first time.
As with spoken languages, these are best absorbed
by immersing yourself in the different environments
and practicing your skills by experimentation.

## Integrity of Scholarship

University rules on integrity of scholarship will be strictly enforced. By
taking this course, you implicitly agree to abide by the UCSD Policy on
Integrity of Scholarship described [here](https://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/appendices/2).
In particular,

> all academic work will be done by the student to whom it is assigned,
> without unauthorized aid of any kind.

You are expected to do your own work on all assignments.
You may, and are encouraged to, engage in **general**
discussions with your classmates regarding the assignments,
but specific details of a solution, including the solution
itself, **must always be your own work**.

You may use Copilot/ChatGPT etc. for your programming assignments,
but do so at your own risk: the midterm(s) and final examinations
will be *heavily* based on the assignments, and doing well in them
will require a thorough understanding the solutions to the programming
assignments.  These exams will be entirely analog: no tools other than
your brain and a writing instrument are to be used.

Incidents which violate the University's rules on integrity of scholarship
will be taken seriously.  In addition to **receiving a zero (0)** on the
assignment/exam in question, students may also face other penalties,
up to and including, expulsion from the University.  Should you have
any doubts about the moral and/or ethical implications of an activity
regarding the course, please see the instructor.

## Research

Your class work might be used for research purposes. For example, we may
use anonymized student assignments to design algorithms or build tools to
help programmers. Any student who wishes to opt out can contact the
instructor or TA to do so after final grades have been issued.
**This has no impact on your grade in any manner.**
